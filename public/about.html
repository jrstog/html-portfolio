My professional history includes 2.5 years of working at General Motors. I began as part of their TRACK rotational program
which allowed me to try out 4 different roles, changing every 6 months. During this time I held positions as: 
<ul>
  <li>a Big Data Software Developer</li> 
  <li>a Domain Lead for Audio, Augmented Reality, and Navigation Systems</li>
  <li>a Data Analyst</li>
  <li>a Software Engineer on the Simulator Emulator team</li>
</ul>
Since finishing the TRACK program I have been working as an In-Vehicle Services Software Developer.
